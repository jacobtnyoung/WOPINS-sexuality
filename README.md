### ***Abstract***

Sexuality and social integration are foundational concepts for understanding women’s incarceration experiences yet are infrequent foci of contemporary carceral research. This study reevaluates classic themes with network and health data collected in two Pennsylvania women’s prison units (n=118). Incarcerated women perceived a high prevalence of sexual relationships and an overall absence of homophobic attitudes in prison. Network and correlational analyses suggest that sexual minority women had similar health and social outcomes as heterosexual peers. However, older women serving long prison sentences held more unfavorable views toward prison sex than their peers, suggesting such behaviors produced perceived negative externalities that older women wished to reduce.
